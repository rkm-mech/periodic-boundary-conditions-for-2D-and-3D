# periodic-boundary-conditions-for-2D-and-3D
The code creates an input file for Abaqus with the coupling required for applying periodic boundary conditions to a square/rectangle and cube/cuboid with the desired size and number of elements.
It takes care of the periodicity, while it allows you to apply your desired loading/fixing conditions.
